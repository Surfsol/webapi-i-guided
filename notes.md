# Notes

[client] == HTTP(requests, responses) == [api]

HTTP

-http methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE ...)
-http message
    - header
    - body (when send data, it is in body)
-request
-response

<!-- example: axios.get is a request -->
[client] makes a request to the [server/api]

<!-- api sees request and produces a response -->
[server] sends a response to the [client]
